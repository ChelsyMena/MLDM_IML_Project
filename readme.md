# KNN Project

## Code
- [ ] function for the random selection, used for train test split and cross validation
- [ ] function for the distance
- [ ] function for the accuracy
- [ ] function for the time spent on prediction
- [ ] function for knn
	- [ ] deal with cases where majority vote is tied: random, closest distance?
- [ ] EDA:
	- [ ] quick overviews of the dataset, mean and stdevs for the 21 features
	- [ ] feature by feature distributions maybe, q-q plots to test normality
- [ ] cross validation: 
	- [ ] how many folds? - search literature to justify
	- [ ] tune the k in each fold? how to choose the k after
	- [ ] plots
		- [ ] accuracy vs k
- [ ] data reduction algorithms
	- [ ] Bayesian region cleaning
		- [ ] run the algorithm with the best k again and compare time and accuracy
	- [ ] the one that removers the middle of the cluster 
		- [ ] run the algorithm with the best k again and compare time and accuracy
- [ ] Methods for speeding up the calculation
	- [ ] precalculate the distance matrix
		- [ ] run the algorithm (with the original dataset) with the best k again and compare time and accuracy
		- [ ] run the algorithm (with the double cleaned dataset) with the best k again and compare time and accuracy
- [ ] Imbalanced Dataset
